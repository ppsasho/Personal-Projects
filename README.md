# Personal projects
Welcome user!
Here, you'll discover a collection of projects developed by me, using both JavaScript and C#.
Each folder contains a detailed description of the project's purpose and functionality,
providing insights into the problem it solves or the concept it explores.
## Feel free to check out my projects and let me know what you think!
